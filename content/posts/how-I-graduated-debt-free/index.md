### 1.) Decided in High school that I would not go into debt for college.

I made up my mind that I would not take any loans while in pursuit of higher education during my freshmen year of high school, which is probably the most important thing to do when tackling the challenge of getting a college degree in the U.S. 

Because it is all to easy to say *yes* and end up in tens, if **not** hundreds of thousands of dollars of debt.

### 2.) Took AP and Dual Credit classes for the GPA boost and free college credits.

I was an A and mostly B student but thanks to the AP and Dual Credit classes that was enough to be in the **top 5%** of my graduating class, which in Texas gave the automatic acceptance to **the** University of Texas, but didn't earn me a full ride scholarship from them, not even a partial ride. So I said no to them and several other **big name** Universities that only offered me loans. 

See point (1).

### 3.) Participated in extracurricular

I played varsity tennis from freshmen year on with hopes it would lead to some scholarship offers and it did but only to a few D3 universities. To their credit they where partial scholarships and I would have only ended up in tens of thousands of dollars of debt thanks to scholarships and not hundreds, but still, not enough for me. 

See point (1).

I was also VP of Art club, which did help me get a small onetime scholarship of 1K for use on a textbook or two.


### 4.) Pestered my scholarship coordinator.

In high school there is a person, whose only job is to keep track of all the scholarships that are only available for high schoolers and even better only available for the high school you're currently enrolled in. I scheduled meetings to meet with them and asked them about all the scholarships I could apply for. By doing this I was able to get a few other small 1K scholarships to help with textbooks and lab supplies. 

### 5.) Used Google to find more scholarships.

I mostly relied on (4) which was a big mistake because the scholarship coordinator didn't know about or share several full-ride scholarships that are only available to high school students. Google may not give you the immediate answer but with enough digging and changing of search strings it can return that hidden webpage that shows a **full-ride** opportunity.


### 6.) FAIL! I did not get a full ride scholarship offer in High School.

So I made a choice that is considered taboo. 

I decided to go to community college and while there I still did steps **1,3,4, and 5**.


### 7.) Joined Phi Theta Kappa.

I became an active member in **Phi Theta Kappa**, which is the community college honor society open to all who earn a GPA above 3.5.

I eventually became an officer and helped my chapter to place in the top ten at the international convention, which led to me meeting the representatives of a full-ride transfer scholarship foundation who encouraged me to apply. 

### 8.) SUCCESS! Full-ride

I applied for and won the Terry Transfer Scholarship which is a full-ride scholarship with room, board, food, and study abroad included. 

**NOTE** The Terry Scholarship is also available for high schoolers as well something my high school coordinator didn't tell me. To be fair I don't think they knew about it.
