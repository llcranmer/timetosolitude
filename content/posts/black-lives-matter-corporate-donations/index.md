# List of Corporations HAVE Donated

I decided to create a spreadsheet to track which companies are donating to Black Lives Matter and which aren't that are within the top fortune 500.

So, far this is the result of the **top 100** as pulled from [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_largest_companies_in_the_United_States_by_revenue)
